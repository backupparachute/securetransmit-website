    <h2>Encryption</h2>
    <p>All data is encrypted in transit and at rest using industry-standard AES-256 encryption. We use secure protocols (SFTP, FTPS, HTTPS) for all file transfers.</p>
    <h2>Zero-Knowledge Architecture</h2>
    <p>We employ a zero-knowledge security model, meaning only you have access to your data. Our staff cannot view your files or sensitive information.</p>
    <h2>Compliance</h2>
    <p>Secure Transmit is designed to help you meet regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2. We provide audit trails and reporting for compliance needs.</p>
    <h2>User Safety</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts</li>
      <li>Role-based access controls</li>
      <li>Continuous monitoring and threat detection</li>
      <li>Regular security audits and penetration testing</li>
    </ul>
