**Rule: enforce_commas_for_pauses**

Avoid using em-dashes (â€”), double hyphens (--), hyphens used as breaks (-), or semicolons (;) to create pauses in sentences. These marks tend to interrupt natural flow and make writing feel robotic or over-engineered.

âœ… Use **commas** for natural pauses. If a comma feels awkward, **rewrite the sentence** for clarity and ease of reading.

They agreed; the deal would move forward.  
Itâ€™s simple--just follow the instructions.

**Rule of thumb:**  
Write like you're speaking directly to someone. If you're using punctuation to pause for drama or emphasis, rewrite it to sound human and conversational.

**Write for people, not prompts.**
