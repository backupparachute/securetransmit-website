To protect critical information, businesses rely on secure file transfer protocols like Secure Transfer's SFTP and FTPS (FTP Secure). While both provide encryption and security, they have distinct differences in implementation and use cases.

## Key Differences Between SFTP and FTPS

### SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)
- **Encryption**: Uses SSH (Secure Shell) for encryption
- **Port**: Typically uses port 22
- **Authentication**: SSH key-based or password authentication
- **Firewall Friendly**: Single port connection
- **Platform Support**: Excellent cross-platform support

### FTPS (FTP Secure)
- **Encryption**: Uses SSL/TLS encryption
- **Port**: Uses separate ports for control (21) and data
- **Authentication**: Certificate-based or password authentication
- **Firewall Friendly**: Requires multiple ports
- **Platform Support**: Good support, especially on Windows

## When to Use SFTP

SFTP is ideal when you need:
- **Simple firewall configuration** (single port)
- **Cross-platform compatibility**
- **SSH infrastructure already in place**
- **Automated file transfers**

## When to Use FTPS

FTPS is better when you need:
- **Legacy FTP compatibility**
- **Certificate-based authentication**
- **Specific compliance requirements**
- **Integration with existing FTP workflows**

## Security Considerations

Both protocols provide strong encryption, but SFTP generally offers:
- **Simpler key management**
- **Better integration with SSH infrastructure**
- **More consistent security model**

FTPS provides:
- **Familiar FTP interface**
- **Certificate-based security**
- **Compatibility with existing FTP tools**

## Performance Comparison

- **SFTP**: Generally slower due to encryption overhead
- **FTPS**: Can be faster with proper configuration
- **Bandwidth**: Both protocols have similar bandwidth usage

## Implementation Recommendations

For most modern environments, **SFTP is recommended** due to:
- **Simpler configuration**
- **Better security model**
- **Cross-platform compatibility**
- **Easier firewall management**

However, **FTPS may be preferred** when:
- **Legacy systems require FTP compatibility**
- **Certificate-based authentication is required**
- **Specific compliance standards mandate FTPS**

## Conclusion

Both SFTP and FTPS provide secure file transfer capabilities. The choice between them depends on your specific requirements, existing infrastructure, and compliance needs. For most modern implementations, SFTP offers the best balance of security, simplicity, and compatibility.
