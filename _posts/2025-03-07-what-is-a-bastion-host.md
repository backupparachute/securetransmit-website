As cyber threats continue to evolve, organizations face increasing pressure to secure remote access to their critical infrastructure. Unauthorized access, data breaches, and insider threats are constant risks, especially in cloud and enterprise environments where administrators and engineers need remote connectivity. One of the most effective tools for controlling and securing remote access is a bastion host.

A bastion host serves as a highly secured gateway that allows authorized users to access internal systems while keeping the main network isolated from the public internet. Whether deployed in on-premises networks or cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP, bastion hosts provide an extra layer of protection by restricting access, enforcing authentication policies, and logging all activity for security monitoring.

In today's interconnected digital world, leaving administrative access wide open to the internet is a major security risk. Attackers continuously scan for exposed SSH and RDP ports, looking for vulnerabilities to exploit. A bastion host minimizes these risks by acting as the single, controlled access point to sensitive resources.

Understanding the role of bastion hosts can help IT teams and security professionals improve access control, reduce attack surfaces, and strengthen their overall security posture. One crucial tool used for securing remote access to private networks is the bastion host. Whether in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP or traditional on-premises networks, bastion hosts act as an additional layer of security by restricting direct access to internal systems.

A bastion host is a hardened server that provides secure access to critical infrastructure while reducing the risk of exposure to cyber threats. It serves as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized users can access internal servers.

## Key Insights

## What Is a Bastion Host?

A [bastion host](https://www.strongdm.com/what-is/bastion-host) is a critical security component in modern network infrastructure, acting as a hardened intermediary server that enables secure remote access to internal systems. It serves as a protective gateway, restricting external access to prevent unauthorized intrusion while allowing legitimate users to connect to private resources.

Organizations deploy bastion hosts to minimize attack surfaces, ensuring that sensitive servers and applications remain hidden from direct exposure to the public internet. Rather than allowing users to connect directly to internal systems, a bastion host functions as a controlled access point, verifying identities, enforcing security policies, and logging all [activities for compliance](/blog/what-is-data-compliance/) and monitoring.

Bastion hosts are widely used across enterprise environments, cloud platforms, and hybrid infrastructures, ensuring that IT administrators, DevOps engineers, and security teams can remotely manage critical systems without compromising security.

## Key Functions of a Bastion Host

Bastion hosts are designed with security-first principles, providing a variety of crucial functions:

### Single Point of Secure Access

Provides a single hardened entryway for administrators to [access private resources securely](/solutions/).

### Minimizes Attack Surface

Reduces the risk of exposure by preventing direct access to internal networks.

### Authentication & Authorization

Ensures that only verified users can connect, using SSH keys, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and role-based access control (RBAC).

### Network Segmentation

Placed in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to act as a security buffer between external and internal networks.

### Access Logging & Monitoring

Records all login attempts and activities, providing detailed audit logs for compliance and forensic analysis.

### Enforces Least Privilege Access

Limits access to only necessary systems and users, reducing the potential for insider threats.

## Why Bastion Hosts Are Essential

In today's threat-heavy digital landscape, leaving remote administrative access open to the internet is a massive security risk. Attackers are constantly scanning for open SSH and RDP ports, looking for weak authentication mechanisms and unpatched vulnerabilities. A bastion host eliminates these risks by acting as the only entry point for authorized users while keeping all other internal systems completely inaccessible from the outside world.

- Acts as a single entry point for remote administrators to access private infrastructure.
- Minimizes the attack surface by only allowing connections through a controlled environment.
- Prevents direct SSH/RDP access to sensitive systems.
- Enhances network security by enforcing strict authentication methods.

## How a Bastion Host Works

Bastion hosts follow a structured security model that ensures only authenticated users can gain access to internal resources while keeping external threats at bay. Here's how they function:

1. **User Connects to the Bastion Host**
   - The user initiates a connection to the bastion host via SSH (for Linux-based systems) or RDP (for Windows-based systems).
   - The bastion host typically resides in a secure subnet or DMZ.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Users must verify their identity using:
     - SSH key-based authentication (instead of passwords for enhanced security).
     - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (e.g., requiring an OTP from a mobile authenticator app).
     - Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict permissions based on job function.

3. **Secure Access to Internal Systems**
   - Once authenticated, users are allowed to jump from the bastion host to specific internal resources, following strict security policies.
   - The internal servers remain invisible to the public, reducing exposure to cyber threats.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - All activities on the bastion host are logged and audited, ensuring compliance with security regulations (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA, and ISO 27001).
   - Administrators can monitor access logs using SIEM tools to detect suspicious behavior and unauthorized access attempts.

5. **Session Termination and Cleanup**
   - After use, the session is securely closed, and temporary credentials (if used) are revoked.
   - Some organizations enforce automatic session timeouts for additional security.

By following this workflow, bastion hosts provide a secure and efficient way to manage privileged access to critical systems without exposing them directly to the internet. A bastion host is placed in a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone), between the public internet and internal network resources. It functions as follows:

1. User connects to the bastion host using SSH (Secure Shell) or RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).
2. The bastion host authenticates the user using SSH keys, MFA, or other security measures.
3. Once authenticated, the user gains access to internal resources but only through the bastion host.
4. All activity is logged for security auditing and monitoring.

## Use Cases for a Bastion Host

Bastion hosts play a crucial role in securing network infrastructure across various industries. Their ability to **control access, enforce authentication, and provide secure remote management** makes them indispensable in a wide range of security scenarios. Below are some of the most common use cases where bastion hosts provide value:

### 1. Secure Remote Access for IT Administrators

One of the primary use cases of a bastion host is to **allow IT administrators to securely manage servers and critical infrastructure**. Without a bastion host, administrators would need to expose SSH or RDP ports directly to the internet, making them vulnerable to brute-force attacks and unauthorized access attempts.

**How It Works:**
- The administrator logs into the **bastion host using SSH or RDP**.
- Once authenticated, they gain access to **internal servers** within the protected network.
- **All activity is logged** for auditing and compliance purposes.
